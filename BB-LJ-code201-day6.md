<h1># BB LJ Code 201 - Day 6 </h1>

<p>Beginning week 2! I put hours into reading the book prior to coming to class. It was helpful for the objects part which I spent a lot of time on at home. However, the append() stuff I didn't get as good a grasp on before going into class. Then I got lost on the example in class so by the time I got the the homework I need lot of hits and hand holding. I still struggle a little on synax mainly when to use (). I just throw them in whenever I want to group something which is not the case. Ummmmmm also when things get lotsOfName.withLotsOfDots.inBetween consider me lost.
