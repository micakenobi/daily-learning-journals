<h1># BB LJ Code 201 - Day 18, March 29, 2016 </h1>

<p>Today our goal was to get an MVP for the space project. I worked on the CSS for the front page which was a good experience. I learned that the float property doesn't work when you have a position: absolute. You have to change the position: relative if you want to use the float property (it floats left/right relative to it's parent container). I also worked with the hover property to CSS the subscribe button a bit. This morning I spent time redoing the quiz CSS because it got merged over on accident.</p>
