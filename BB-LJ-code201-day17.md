<h1># BB LJ Code 201 - Day 17, March 28, 2016 </h1>

<p>Way better with merge parties today! We resolved a merge conflict regarding a css file on GitHub today. The project is coming together nicely, we are hoping to have a MVP by tomorrow afternoon. We changed how our directory was set up so there was a bit of figuring out how to get things talking from page/page and html talking to the css and js files. The task manager is helpful on GitHub. Once we get gone with a task we can go move it to "done" and as bugs appear we can add those for "todo" so we don't forget they exist.</p>
