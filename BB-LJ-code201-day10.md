<h1># BB LJ Code 201 - Day 10 </h1>

<p>Week two has come to a close. I like building things. I like organizing projects and mapping out a plan. If I can't map it out-- I can't build it. If I can draw out how I think the project will work then I can build it. But I'm not to the point were when I look at a bunch of code it looks like a story. I really need to break it down bit by bit. I still am not able to visualize myself in 401 or much less being an asset to a team. The talk today during lunch "The First 90 days" was really interesting. It was interesting to hear his experience and advice. While I listened with open ears (and took notes) I can't yet visualize myself as being an asset to a team. I hope I can be! I wonder if long term maybe I would be good at project planning or something. Just along for the ride right now!</p>
