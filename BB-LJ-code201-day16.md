<h1># BB LJ Code 201 - Day 16, March 27, 2016 </h1>

<p>I think we did a good job today working as a group. We were able to divvy up the tasks using GitHub task manager. We had minimal merge commits but LOTS of trouble navigating local/remote branches. We made progress on getting some information up each of the webpages (home, quiz, planets).</p>
