<h1># BB LJ Code 201 - Day 15, March 24, 2016 </h1>

<p>Working through merge conflicts was helpful today. Also, doing them as part of the same team we will do project week with was a good foundation for communication. We were able to communicate through our project adding/changing features and creating a MVP vs stretch goals. We also made a skeleton for each page. We assigned jobs for this weekend regarding gathering planet images, quiz questions, and other images that will be used for our project. </p>
