<h1># BB LJ Code 201 - Day 8 </h1>

<p>Mid-week of Week 2. I feel it is getting more intuitive to read code and understand what it is doing. I created a form today which turned out well. I was pretty stoked to be able to get the data the user imputed and pass that into my constructor function. I think it would be good to practice more or the properties that the event objects can do in order to help fully understand the event concept. </p>
