<h1># BB LJ Code 201 - Day 20, March 31, 2016 </h1>

<p>Today was presentation day and overall the project came together very nicely. Looking back and comparing last Friday's paper/pencil sketches to today's product show how well we carried through with the goals we set as a team. My favorite part today was seeing other team projects. We all created very unique projects which shows the value of how a diverse team can create innovative products.</p>
