**Journal Day 5**

 well folks, the first week is done. Just trying to soak in as much as possible. nervous about next week since it's suppose to be loads of info. I think if I would've taken the week long Intro to Java this week would've gone a lot better. The books are super helpful. I should probably talk about what I learned. It's 11pm and my brain feels like french toast. I wrote about how I thought through the testing homework on the canvas submission. It was interesting to see my thought process through that. I enjoyed the thought process. As I gain more tools I see I'll have more tools in my toolbox to write code. I think the git stuff was toughest of anything to wrap my mind around this week. So maybe next week won't be so bad. It seriously is like learning a new language. I don't know the vocabulary that is used in instructions so the learning barrier is steep. Fun when something works though! definitely get a little rush of excitement with those mini success
